#                 
# Register Usage
#
#       t0:register for storing address of current entry
#       t1:store the char to compute hash code/store the entry to be test
#	t2:store integer 128
#       t3:	
#	t4:unique identifier component
#       t5:counter of length of the string
#       t6:register for storing various values
#       t9:contain the address of interning string and never change
